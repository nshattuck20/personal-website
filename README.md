# Web blog 
My goal with this project is to build a simple web page with posts. The posts will be eventually created by me about topics pertaining to Python, 
Data Science, and various other developer topics. **This is not a blog about my personal life. The intention is purely for professional reasons.** I used 
the tutorial from [Flask's website](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/tutorial/) to help me learn and get started. 

### I am using the following technologies: 
* Flask 
* Bootstrap 
* SQL
